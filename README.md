##  Stable Diffusion{for understanding the architecture}
This project is a learning-focused implementation of the Stable Diffusion model, inspired by Umar Jamil’s YouTube on building diffusion models from scratch. I felt that some of the explanations in his videos were a bit vague, so I’ve expanded on them with detailed comments and illustrations throughout the code.
<br> 

##  Key Features
Video Output: Added a video argument to generate a visualization of the diffusion process.
Sampling: Currently uses the DDPM sampler
Pretrained Weights: Using pretrained weights due to limited compute resources.
<br> 


##  Improvements
The current sampler uses DDPM, but I plan to add the DDIM sampler next, which is faster and more efficient.
<br> 


##  Future Plans
The current model produces decent results, but I plan to fine-tune and distill it to generate manga-style images, which I think would be pretty cool.
